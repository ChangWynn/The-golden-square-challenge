# Golden Square Takeaway Project
### Makers Academy Bootcamp

_The code is probably more complex than it needed to be but I took this challenge as a great opportunity to practice everything I could think of._


Here is the user story for this project

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.
```

We were asked to use the twilio-ruby gem to implement this next one.

```
As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text after I have ordered, such as 
"Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52"
```
